# DBMS_FILE_REPOSITORY_SYSTEM
Hey Guys!

I have made a DBMS consisting of three sorting trees(AVL, RED BLACK, and B-Trees) and have 7 possible fields to index this data.

It is actually a file management system connected with each other by pointers (Addresses). I worked on files(text files) to store data instead of databases.

It has a very unique feature of "Where Clause" which is used in the most powerful Language SQL.

Furthermore, I have included the AI-Generated Voice for understanding.
 B tree is in the zip folder 
and other two trees have there Sln respectively
