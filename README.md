# DBMS_FILE_REPOSITORY_SYSTEM
Hey Guys!

I have made a DBMS consisting of three sorting trees(AVL, RED BLACK, and B-Trees) and have 7 possible fields to index this data.

It is actually a file management system connected with each other by pointers (Addresses). I worked on files(text files) to store data instead of databases.

It has a very unique feature of "Where Clause" which is used in the most powerful Language SQL.

Furthermore, I have included the AI-Generated Voice for understanding.
 B tree is in the zip folder 
and other two trees have there Sln respectively

Here's a sample README.md file for your project:

# Data Structures Project

This project contains the implementation of various data structures in C++. It includes the following files:

## Files

- `Avl.h`: AVL tree implementation.
- `B-Tree.zip`: ZIP file containing B-Tree implementation.
- `Black.h`: Implementation of a black tree.
- `DS 2.vcxproj`: Visual Studio project file.
- `DS 2.vcxproj.filters`: Visual Studio project filter file.
- `DS 2.vcxproj.user`: Visual Studio user-specific project file.
- `NCHS_-_Leading_Causes_of_Death__United_States_X.csv`: CSV files containing leading causes of death in the United States (X ranges from 1 to 10).
- `README.md`: This file.
- `Source.cpp`: Main source code file.
- `Support.h`: Supporting header file.
- `details.wav`, `end.wav`, `error.wav`, `music1.wav`, `music2.wav`, `music3.wav`, `note_new.txt`, `start.wav`, `victory.wav`: Audio and text files used in the project.
- `redblack.vcxproj`: Visual Studio project file for the Red-Black tree implementation.
- `redblack.vcxproj.filters`: Visual Studio project filter file for the Red-Black tree implementation.
- `redblack.vcxproj.user`: Visual Studio user-specific project file for the Red-Black tree implementation.

## Description

This project contains various data structures implemented in C++. The data structures include AVL tree, B-Tree, and Black tree. The project also includes CSV files containing leading causes of death in the United States. The main source code file is `Source.cpp`, and the supporting header file is `Support.h`. The audio and text files are used for sound effects and additional information in the project.

## Usage

To use the project, simply download or clone the repository and open it in your preferred C++ development environment. Build and run the project to execute the data structures and explore their functionality.

Feel free to modify and enhance the code according to your requirements.
