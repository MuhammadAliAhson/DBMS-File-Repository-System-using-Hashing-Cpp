# DBMS File Repository System - Open Hashing

This repository, named "DBMS_FILE_REPOSITORY_SYSTEM_OPEN_HASHING," contains the project files for a database management system file repository system using open hashing. The repository includes the following folders:

1. Avl
   - This folder contains the implementation of an AVL (Adelson-Velsky and Landis) tree data structure. It provides efficient operations for inserting, deleting, and searching elements in a self-balancing binary search tree.

2. B-Tree
   - This folder contains the implementation of a B-Tree data structure. It is designed to handle large amounts of data and provides efficient operations for insertion, deletion, and searching in logarithmic time complexity.

3. Red Black Tree
   - This folder contains the implementation of a Red-Black Tree data structure. It is a self-balancing binary search tree that guarantees logarithmic time complexity for insertion, deletion, and searching operations.

4. Compressed Files
   - This folder contains compressed files related to the project. It may include archives, zip files, or other compressed formats.

5. Dataset 1
   - This folder contains Dataset 1, which is used in the project. The dataset is relevant to the file repository system and can be used for testing, analysis, or other purposes.

6. Music
   - This folder contains music files associated with the project. It may include audio files, soundtracks, or other audio-related resources.
